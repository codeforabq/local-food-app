## Installation
You're going to want to make sure you have (Vagrant)[https://www.vagrantup.com/] installed in order to make this work.

Once you have it installed, go ahead and run `vagrant up` from this directory to get the vagrant box setup, followed by `vagrant ssh` to enter the box.

Next, cd to `/vagrant` inside the box and run the following commands

- `npm install`
- `node index.js`

Your site will be running on `localhost:3000`
